The main things that were discussed were how they&amp;#39;re incorporating technology and blogging in their everyday class life.  It was pretty amazing how Kathy Cassidy has little grade ones writing daily blogs, posting pictures, and commenting. The other guy was Darren Kuropatwa and he had some interesting things to say as well. I was very impressed that he has Math students doing their notes and equations on the site everyday. It&amp;#39;s also good that he has them take turns. It was interesting to see how they started to get into the whole blogging thing. The way Kathy really got into it was by her class posting blogs and then having other child bloggers from around the world commenting on their stuff.  Dean was saying that this technology is good for his school. Since he comes from a small town it helps them to be more connected and excited about school. All of them do a ton with technology... from creating wikis to writing blogs, to playing with Nintendo DS&amp;#39;s, making radio plays, and much more. There have been very few negative problems with incorporating technology.  There have been a few problems here and there, but nothing too serious.  I found the session interesting and would like to see a school that truly embodies the ideas that the presenters shared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff00ff&quot; class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
