 <title>Getting up and running. . .</title>
 <link>https://ejournalism.lskysd.ca/node/22</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Guess what, just wrote a super blog entry about our travels, set up and current issues.  However, when trying to insert an image, I lost my content.  And honestly it was good.  Rife with quotes from Hamlet, you really would&amp;#39;ve enjoyed it.  However, such is a semi-charmed techno life.  DO OVER. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So, after a challenging travel day full of rain, snow, calls to department of highways, we all arrived.  Late, but ambitious, our command centre was eventually set up in the Shakespeare Room.  By midnight, we were wondering if we would were meant &lt;em&gt;to be or not to be. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mrs. Cey gave us an inspiring speech reminding students that  &lt;em&gt;the clothes make the man&lt;/em&gt; and above all as journalists, &lt;em&gt;to thine own self, and to the truth, be true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So this morning, we are re-routering, re-networking, painfully plodding through content with underwater speed.  Now that we finally have school email, we feel less alienated.  So,  off we go!!  Stay tuned!!&lt;/p&gt;
