    <p><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333"><strong>C. P. Bazin Webster</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333"></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">From my less than comfortable seat on the floor by the door, I blatantly violated fire codes and craned my neck to see the screen.<span>  </span>I knew a fair bit about Podcasting already [read: I knew <i>nothing</i> about Podcasting], but nonetheless, I listened carefully.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">One of the first and foremost things I heard is that Podcasting makes classrooms come alive (or something to that effect, someone stepped on my hand as the presenter was saying it).<span>  </span>We were treated to some audio clips that some young thundercats (children) had created.<span>  </span>Even for young kids, they did a really good job.<span>  </span>They sounded natural and easy to understand, and of course, that perfect blend of innocence and imperfection that only young kids being recorded can master.<span>  </span>They were able to open up the learning and convey the material within a safe, user friendly context.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">The floor immediately opened up and the group engaged in a discussion about Audacity and Garage Band.<span>  </span>I have used the latter and frankly, I love it, despite the fact there has to be a fruit on the computer.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">The main constructive criticism that Podcasters receive is that they <b><i>must </i></b>be able to self-regulate; that is, they must turn out a product with a suitable length.<span>  </span>Three to four minutes is generally considered the absolute maximum for informative material.<span>  </span>Make it even less if you find yourself droning on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on carrot and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">I essentially inferred that a Podcast is nothing more than an audio clip used as a medium to convey a message, be it humorous, informative, serious, etc.<span>  </span>They provide an interactive way to communicate.<span>  </span>Video casts can also be used, but they are less common.<span>  </span>Furthermore, audio programs like Garage Band can be used to add sound effects, remove stutters, enhance quality, etc.<span>  </span>This laptop is extremely warm on <i>my</i> lap top, and my legs are asleep.<span>  </span>The things I do for you Lois…</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">After hearing many different speeches at the <city w:st="on"></city><br />
<place w:st="on"></place>Summit, I have already thought of a lot of pros for Podcasting on my own already.<span>  </span>For example, many teachers have been using Wikis and Google Docs and some-such-forth to communicate with students in other parts of the world.<span>  </span>They can collaborate on projects and share useful learning information.<span>  </span>With a podcast, students could get a chance to hear another class’ dialect and native tongue that could never be fully experienced in writing.<span>  </span>Podcasts also provide ways for people to communicate their thoughts interactively with people far across the world that would otherwise not be an option.<span>  </span>Many Podcasts are professionally edited to imitate radio programs, and some can even be clips taken <i>from</i> TV shows or audio files.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff"><font face="times new roman,times"><font size="3"><font style="background-color: #333333">I never really fully grasped how Podcasting could serve as such a valuable learning aid.<span>  </span>It also betters non-educational applications, such as for sheer entertainment purposes.<span>  </span>We were treated to some absolutely hilarious British humor as an example of a Podcast.<span>  </span>If anyone, schools included, needs an effective, free method to interactively share information, I would whole-heartedly endorse Podcasting, even though I know little more than just the basics.<span>  </span>Someone just left – dare I steal their seat?<span>  </span>Never mind, I am nearly done.<span>  </span>Anyhow, people can control what they share and don’t share, people can remain totally anonymous, and they are super easy to create.<span>  </span>With minimal investment, one can produce professional Podcasts and sound clips.<span>  </span></font></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">All in all, I am glad I was able to sit in on this speech. </font></p>

<p><font color="#ffffff" style="background-color: #333333"></font></p>
<p></p></span><span lang="EN-CA"><font color="#ffffff"><font style="background-color: #333333">After some witty banter (praise Warlick), we got down to brass tacks.<span>  </span>Contrary to common belief, kids do not need to develop many more skills in order to survive the technological age.<span>  </span>They can get by with the same skills they have always had – they are just broadened much more than they were before. </font></font></span><span lang="EN-CA">

<p></p></span><span lang="EN-CA"><font color="#ffffff"><font style="background-color: #333333">One of the more startling theories we must consider in recent years is that corporations are affecting what it means to be literate.<span>  </span>After Apple started selling Podcasts on iTunes, lectures and other audio and video files became thousands of times more accessible than ever before.<span>  </span>Blogging has become a technological revolution.<span>  </span>Not just peoples’ personal blogs, but news companies and such have adopted a type of blogging.<span>  </span>As new news stories come in, they are posted to a blog.<span>  </span>People can read the text and leave comments as they please.<span>  </span>As more facts come in, more blog entries are posted, and the preliminary headlines are gradually sent to the bottom and eventually disappear.<span>  </span><span> </span><span>  </span> </font></font></span><span lang="EN-CA">

<place w:st="on"></place>Cambodia.<span>  </span>Students from all over the world can collaborate on projects that are limitless.<span>  </span>Not only do the students learn in an interesting way, many actually want to learn more. </font></font></span><span lang="EN-CA">
<p><font color="#ffffff" style="background-color: #333333"></font></p>
<p><span lang="EN-CA"><font color="#ffffff"><font style="background-color: #333333">However, kids need to know how to access relevant information.<span>  </span>They need to know how to filter the pertinent information through and forget about the rest of the stuff.<span>  </span>On the opposite end of the spectrum, over-filtering on Big Brother’s end is also a bad thing.<span>  </span>Simply giving kids access to information is not enough.<span>  </span>They need to know what to do with it, how to use it, why they should use it.<span>  </span>Kids can do nearly anything on a computer, such as download music, but may not know how to get the most out of a computer for academic purposes. </font></font></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-CA"></span><span lang="EN-CA"><font color="#ffffff"><font style="background-color: #333333">Another thing some kids forget to do is simply use their brains.<span>  </span>They can be easily fooled by an attractive, professional looking web page that portrays hoaxes or urban legends as fact.<span>  </span>It all comes back to knowing what to filter.<span>  </span><span> </span></font></font></span></p>
