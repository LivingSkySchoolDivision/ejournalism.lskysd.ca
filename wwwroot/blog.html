<p><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333"></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">From my less than comfortable seat on the floor by the door, I blatantly violated fire codes and craned my neck to see the screen.<span>  </span>I knew a fair bit about Podcasting already [read: I knew <i>nothing</i> about Podcasting], but nonetheless, I listened carefully.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">One of the first and foremost things I heard is that Podcasting makes classrooms come alive (or something to that effect, someone stepped on my hand as the presenter was saying it).<span>  </span>We were treated to some audio clips that some young thundercats (children) had created.<span>  </span>Even for young kids, they did a really good job.<span>  </span>They sounded natural and easy to understand, and of course, that perfect blend of innocence and imperfection that only young kids being recorded can master.<span>  </span>They were able to open up the learning and convey the material within a safe, user friendly context.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">The floor immediately opened up and the group engaged in a discussion about Audacity and Garage Band.<span>  </span>I have used the latter and frankly, I love it, despite the fact there has to be a fruit on the computer.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">The main constructive criticism that Podcasters receive is that they <b><i>must </i></b>be able to self-regulate; that is, they must turn out a product with a suitable length.<span>  </span>Three to four minutes is generally considered the absolute maximum for informative material.<span>  </span>Make it even less if you find yourself droning on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on carrot and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">I essentially inferred that a Podcast is nothing more than an audio clip used as a medium to convey a message, be it humorous, informative, serious, etc.<span>  </span>They provide an interactive way to communicate.<span>  </span>Video casts can also be used, but they are less common.<span>  </span>Furthermore, audio programs like Garage Band can be used to add sound effects, remove stutters, enhance quality, etc.<span>  </span>This laptop is extremely warm on <i>my</i> lap top, and my legs are asleep.<span>  </span>The things I do for you Lois…</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">After hearing many different speeches at the <city w:st="on"></city><br />
<place w:st="on"></place>Summit, I have already thought of a lot of pros for Podcasting on my own already.<span>  </span>For example, many teachers have been using Wikis and Google Docs and some-such-forth to communicate with students in other parts of the world.<span>  </span>They can collaborate on projects and share useful learning information.<span>  </span>With a podcast, students could get a chance to hear another class’ dialect and native tongue that could never be fully experienced in writing.<span>  </span>Podcasts also provide ways for people to communicate their thoughts interactively with people far across the world that would otherwise not be an option.<span>  </span>Many Podcasts are professionally edited to imitate radio programs, and some can even be clips taken <i>from</i> TV shows or audio files.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff"><font face="times new roman,times"><font size="3"><font style="background-color: #333333">I never really fully grasped how Podcasting could serve as such a valuable learning aid.<span>  </span>It also betters non-educational applications, such as for sheer entertainment purposes.<span>  </span>We were treated to some absolutely hilarious British humor as an example of a Podcast.<span>  </span>If anyone, schools included, needs an effective, free method to interactively share information, I would whole-heartedly endorse Podcasting, even though I know little more than just the basics.<span>  </span>Someone just left – dare I steal their seat?<span>  </span>Never mind, I am nearly done.<span>  </span>Anyhow, people can control what they share and don’t share, people can remain totally anonymous, and they are super easy to create.<span>  </span>With minimal investment, one can produce professional Podcasts and sound clips.<span>  </span></font></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3" color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" style="background-color: #333333">All in all, I am glad I was able to sit in on this speech. </font></p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" size="3">Mr. David Warlick is a remarkable man. Sitting through his keynote speech was a very eye opening experience that I am sure will have a lot of people thinking for a very long time.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff" face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="times new roman,times"><font color="#ffffff">Mr. Warlick started his presentation by trying to show us just how big the Internet actually is. He explained that in 2002, only a one- hundredth of one percent of all things published was actually printed. The rest of these documents were floating around on the web. He then tried to visually describe the future that teachers are preparing their students for. Slowly, he removed things </font></font></font><font size="3"><font face="times new roman,times"><font color="#ffffff">that we did not know the exact future of </font></font></font><font size="3"><font face="times new roman,times"><font color="#ffffff">out of a digital office . (For example he took out the telephone because it is still evolving and changing every day) When there was nothing left in the office, Warlick had proven his point. We know nothing about the future; It is completely unpredictable. Teachers have a new job criteria; preparing children for a future we can not clearly understand.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> </span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><font face="times new roman,times"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'"></span></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in" class="MsoNormal"><font color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" size="3">Mr. Warlick’s main theme was that we must reinvent and redefine literacy. Teaching today must evolve to suit the world around it. Twenty years ago teaching was reading, writing, and arithmetic. People were taught to read an article that was handed to them by someone who had already evaluated the document and found it to be reliable. Only teaching a student to read, in today’s world that Warlick described, is dangerous. After several examples, David’s point that we must teach children how to first find the information, then critically evaluate it, organize it, and then understand what is true and what is false, was clearly stated. Children must be taught how to decide if an article is worthy because the Internet allows for many things to be posted. </font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff" face="times new roman,times" size="3"></font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="times new roman,times"><font color="#ffffff"><span>          </span>Mr. Warlick said “I will not wear one of these computer jackets, but I am not teaching the children for my future”. Children must learn how to express themselves and in today’s world and in order to make people listen they must be competitive. Learning to write something that grasps people’s attention is an important part of surviving in this world. </font></font></font></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#ffffff"><font face="times new roman,times"><span>          </span>Warlick’s conclusion was that we must stop integrating technology; this is not as new and exciting for the children as it is for us. We must redefine literacy so that it reflects today’s environment and integrate that.</font> </font></font></font></p>

I had the opportunity to listen in to a keynote speaker, Dean Shareski, who spoke with Kathy Cassidy, Clarence Fisher and Darren Kuropatwa.  Each teacher talked about the way they have integrated technology into their classrooms and how it has benefited their students.

<p></p></font></span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial"></span><span style="color: red; font-family: Arial"><font size="3">Some technology they talked about using in the classroom was iPods, laptops, smart boards, scanners and projectors.  The students used their resources to download information, both written and vocal, off the internet.<span>  </span>The speakers invited us into their classrooms through a power point and shared interesting stories.<span>  </span></font></span></p>
<p><font size="3"><font color="#ff0000">Although a teacher’s life is hectic, Cassidy, Fisher and Kuropatwa have managed to work technology into their everyday learning and move away from the traditional classroom.<span>  </span>For example, Cassidy has brought SMART boards and Nintendo DS into her math classes to get the students involved and explore problem solving.</font><span>   </span></font></p>

  <div class="content clear-block">
    <p>     R.O.V.E.R. represents an innovative way for teachers to have videos on demand in a step toward the 21st Century.</p>
<p>R.O.V.E.R- is a &quot;on demand&quot; video streaming service which</p>
<p>                  - is a progressive upgrade to current video services</p>
<p>                  - allows for potential conversion for duplication services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Converting to R.O.V.E.R allows for proactive support  showing immediate notice when server is down as well as the power to track videos down to the millisecond. Also with the capability of storing all servers within the school it allows for no bandwidth problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>    R.O.V.E.R. is represented by members of the Ministry of Education including Sandra Bellegarde, Steven Zimmer, Ron Lawson, and Myrna Martyniuls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  In each district there is one to three pilot sites. However despite the excellent advantages of R.O.V.E.R.  it was presented as a pilot and is not availble to the public until the fall of 2010.</p>

<p><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA">The session was focused on two main things: when, where, and how to use a SMARTboard in a classroom; and the Senteo. One example caught my interest. The use of an overhead projector is nothing new but a simple application on the SMARTboard allows you to use a screen shade to block certain parts of the board. This is essential because when students are trying to focus on learning something and there is a distraction on the side it distracts them from the information being presented. Displaying information with the SMARTboard is faster and can be done more efficiently than the original white board. Collaborative learning is  fun and seems more like a reward to the children than a daily activity and I believe this is vital in the quest for learning for children. </span></p>
<p></p></span>
<p><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA"></span><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA">The other focus point of the session was the </span><span style="color: white">Senteo SMART technology (An interactive response system which provides a direct wireless connection between you and your students). The importance of teachers being able to access information the students need especially in “new units” or when teaching new information could make this tool key in any learning environment. We used the Seneto SMART technology as an example by finding out what percent of the listeners had a SMARTboard in their class room. 52% possessed the smart board. <span> </span>By a simple click of a button on a key pad the teacher could do a diagnostic test and find what percent of his or her class understands the concept and who does not.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: white"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: white"></span><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA">The session in general was very interesting and entertaining. Mrs.Gavel did a great job explaining how to use the smart board and how to utilize all of its applications. Even though there were some technological problems with the SMARTboard, the session went smoothly. </span><span style="color: white" lang="EN-CA">

The other guy was Darren Kuropatwa and he had some interesting things to say as well. I was very impressed that he has Math students doing their notes and equations on the site everyday. It&#39;s also good that he has them take turns. It was interesting to see how they started to get into the whole blogging thing. The way Kathy really got into it was by her class posting blogs and then having other child bloggers from around the world commenting on their stuff.  Dean was saying that this technology is good for his school. Since he comes from a small town it helps them to be more connected and excited about school. All of them do a ton with technology... from creating wikis to writing blogs, to playing with Nintendo DS&#39;s, making radio plays, and much more. There have been very few negative problems with incorporating technology.  There have been a few problems here and there, but nothing too serious.  I found the session interesting and would like to see a school that truly embodies the ideas that the presenters shared.</span></span><span style="color: #ff00ff" class="Apple-style-span"> </span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"> This session starts out with me actually getting there early and the presenter,<b> Mr.Hammond</b> showing a power point explaining ways of using music, digital art and different websites to create stories. These ideas were awesome to get students to be creative, have fun, and get involved retelling or creating stories. You can use only sound or visual art separately or put them together to tell a story. This is great way to see if students comprehend the story&#39;s material and details and to get them to listen to details. The students can also see how musical ideas are developed from stories and how they relate. One program he referred to is GarageBand which is used for creating music using different instrument sounds. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">Another part of the session was about how to teach your students about Comic art- two things you teach them is how to use symbolic imagery, and how to use illustration to make stories more engaging. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">You have to be careful of copyright when working with music and pictures. Even though students will want to use their own music this can be bad because it might be protected. With pictures make sure release forms are signed. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">- When creating stories with music:</p>
